# MPTCP enabled netcat

This repository is a fork of Debian's netcat-openbsd (https://salsa.debian.org/debian/netcat-openbsd.git) that has been modified to enable Multipath TCP on recent Linux kernel (typically version >5.10) where it has been enabled.

This is work in progress. We hope to be able to add MPTCP support to a large number of networked applications.
